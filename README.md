# Hangman-game
This C++ Hangman game uses OOP principles. The Hangman class manages the target word, guesses, and attempts while handling game status and guesses. The Game class inherits Hangman, implementing the main game loop. Players guess letters to reveal the word within 6 attempts, aiming to guess correctly before attempts run out.
